Minor Project - 02

Car Advertising - Determining Futuristic Sales

Aim:
The project's ultimate goal is to build a machine-learning model that could predict the futuristic sales of a car given its current sales and advertising medium.

Hardware/Software Preference:
A Windows PC with Windows 10 or higher software/ Macbook updated to the latest version is Preferable.

Suggested Tools/Tech Stacks:
Python 3 latest version, Jupyter Notebook, or any similar IDE with its most recent version, with necessary libraries/dependencies/packages, could be used for working on this project.

Suggested Approach: 
Step 1:  Download the advertising dataset.
Step 2:  Import it into the environment(say Jupyter Notebook) and store it as a data frame.
Step 3:  Check data for its values, central tendency, and dispersion measures.
Step 4: Perform data preprocessing such as Null value treatment/missing value treatment and outlier treatment.
Step 5: Perform Visualisations, Univariate and Bi-Variate Analyses and find correlations, trends and patterns among the variables.
Step 6: You can now split the data into X and Y to prepare it for training.
Step 7: You can train the data with a Regression Model(say Linear Regression Model) with an appropriate train test split. 
Step 8: Test the data by giving an X-test as a parameter. Now, you can get the value for Y-predicted, which is your futuristic value.
Step 9: Compare it against the original Y-Test value and calculate the MSE, MAE, etc. The model with the slightest error is the best.

Expected Output:
A regression model is built to predict the futuristic sales with present data, and the model's accuracy is measured.
