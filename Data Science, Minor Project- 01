Minor - Project 1

Weather Data Classification-Determining Humidity

Aim:
The project's ultimate goal is to build a machine learning model to find the futuristic humidity level(3 pm) in the air with the measure at present (9 pm) and calculate the accuracy.

Hardware/Software Preference:
A Windows PC with Windows 10 or higher software/ Macbook updated to the latest version is Preferable.

Suggested Tools/Tech Stacks:
Python 3 latest version, Jupyter Notebook, or any similar IDE with its most recent version, with necessary libraries/dependencies/packages, could be used for working on this project.

Suggested Approach: 
Step 1:  Download the daily_weather dataset.
Step 2:  Import it into the environment(say Jupyter Notebook) and store it as a data frame.
Step 3:  Check data for its values,  central tendency, and dispersion measures.
Step 4: Perform data preprocessing such as Null value treatment/missing value treatment and outlier treatment.
Step 5: Classify the values in the final column(y)(I.e. relative humidity at 3pm to be 

'0' if the value is below 25 and '1' if it is above 25)

Step 6: You can now split the data into X and Y to prepare it for training.
Step 7: You can train the data with a Classification Model(Decision Tree Model) with an appropriate train test split. 
Step 8: Test the data by giving an X-test as a parameter. Now, you can get the value for Y-predicted, which is your futuristic value.
Step 9: Compare it against the original Y-Test value and calculate the accuracy score of the model.

Expected Output:
A classification model is built to predict the futuristic humidity level with present data, and the model's accuracy is noted.
